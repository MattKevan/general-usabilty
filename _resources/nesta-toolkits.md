Nesta is an innovation foundation. For us, innovation means turning bold ideas into reality. It also means changing lives for the better. This is what keeps us awake at night and gets us out of bed in the morning.

### Our methods

How do we bring these ideas to life? Weâ€™re restless thinkers. We constantly question and experiment. We tackle challenges through our unique combination of expertise, skills and funding. Our approach is practical and collaborative, driven by a rigorous use of evidence and data, emerging technology and the power of people.
