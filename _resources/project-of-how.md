### Systemic Design Toolkit will help you

#### **Understand why the challenge is hard to tackle** 

Build shared understanding on the structure and interactions in the system, the factors influencing the issue, the most promising areas for intervention.

#### **Explore interventions to start the transformation**

Identify the interventions driving the systemic shift. Co-design the mix of measures and artifacts that will leverage the process of change.

#### **Define and implement your transition plan** 

Plan the implementation and scaling up of your interventions in the short and long term.
