## Responsible tech

Ethical Explorers—from product managers and designers to engineers and founders—are leaders **just like you**. They’re not only asking thoughtful questions about responsible tech but are also focused on building solutions that avoid the potential downsides of technology.

But sometimes it can be difficult knowing where to start.

That’s where the **Ethical Explorer Pack** comes in. Whether you’re launching a new product at a startup or updating software used around the world,  
**consider this a go-to tool** for sparking dialogue, identifying early warning signs, and brainstorming positive solutions.

## Our guiding principles

#### Support human values

Be intentional about building tech that values fundamental human rights, empowers users, and creates healthy online experiences.

#### Create a culture of questioning

Recognize, challenge, and question the decisions we make. The more we use our voices, the more we’ll inspire others to do the same.

#### Ignite change through dialogue

Start small, discover common ground, and empower your team to create human-centered technology—one conversation at a time.
