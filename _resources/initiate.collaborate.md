Choosing methods can be difficult. There are many different design research methods and just as many reasons why one method may be better suited for your project than others. 

The Development Oriented Triangulation (DOT) â€“ Framework offers a good way to understand the differences and similarities between many design research methods. 

This cmdmethods card set and the DOT-framework form a perfect couple. Understanding the framework will help you to use the card set in a better way and the card set aids your understanding of the framework. In this mini-manual we give a brief introduction to the DOT-Framework and the use of this card set.
