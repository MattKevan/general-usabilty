# Who is the lookbook for?

This lookbook is for anyone who wants to get to know Emotion-Centered tools and approaches. You might be a program manager at a community program or a director of a product company, for instance. You might know about Matter–Mind Studio but want to get a taste for what some of the work looks like. You may also be a design student or a fellow researcher looking to explore more ways of working.

### How to Navigate the Lookbook

The ECD tools in this publication come in various formats including frameworks, artifacts and activities. They’re divided into seven categories based on its purpose:

1. **to uncover**: creating a space for people to unearth their tacit knowledge and beliefs
2. **to materialize**: providing a framework for people to externalize and make tangible how they feel
3. **to synthesize**: translating research findings into emotional insights
4. **to illustrate**: visualizing emotional insights
5. **to relate**: supporting people to open up and engage with the space and others
6. **to measure**: evaluating and measuring qualitative outcomes
7. **to maintain**: sustaining newly introduced services, established interventions and organizational structures

### Each tool is introduced with:

* a summary
* a use case project that shows what it looks like in action
* its purpose
* its outcome and impact
* state(s) of mind it cultivates for the individual participating
* the level of difficulty to carry it out for the facilitator
* time it’s likely to take
* its source*
