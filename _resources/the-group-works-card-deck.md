A new project can feel like stepping into the unknownâ€”new people, new perspectives, and not everyone on the same page. initiate.collaborate is a card game that is fun and enables responsive and responsible collaborations.

### How it works:

Through a series of 107 cards (96 for the Design/Health version), a project team is guided through structured activities according to three focus areas critical to successful collaboration.

* **Context** - understanding the collaboration space and different perspectives
* **Connectivity** - building the relationships that ensure effective working models
* **Capability** - developing different kinds of expertise and ways of thinking to ensure everyone contributes and is supported to go in new and interesting directions when required.
