Developed at [GV](http://gv.com/), it’s a “greatest hits” of business strategy, innovation, behavior science, design thinking, and more—packaged into a battle-tested process that any team can use.

Working together in a sprint, you can shortcut the endless-debate cycle and compress months of time into a single week. Instead of waiting to launch a minimal product to understand if an idea is any good, you’ll get clear data from a realistic prototype. The sprint gives you a superpower: You can fast-forward into the future to see your finished product and customer reactions, before making any expensive commitments.

This page is a DIY guide for running your own sprint. On [Monday](https://www.gv.com/sprint/#monday), you’ll map out the problem and pick an important place to focus. On [Tuesday](https://www.gv.com/sprint/#tuesday), you’ll sketch competing solutions on paper. On [Wednesday](https://www.gv.com/sprint/#wednesday), you’ll make difficult decisions and turn your ideas into a testable hypothesis. On [Thursday](https://www.gv.com/sprint/#thursday), you’ll hammer out a high-fidelity prototype. And on [Friday](https://www.gv.com/sprint/#friday), you’ll test it with real live humans.
