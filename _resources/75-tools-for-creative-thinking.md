We believe that if you get a deeper understanding of How you do things, you can also do better in the end. Understanding How is to be agile and being able to solve problems with greater flexibility. Just like with the tip of an iceberg, the end result is only the smaller part of the greater whole. By going below the surface and seeing the process and multitude of skills combined that together amount to something thatâ€™s possible to grasp, that is to have an understanding of How.

If we can bring the whole underlying process into light we can do things better. Clarity gives improved results and empowers people to solve problems with greater understanding. That is the How Focus.
