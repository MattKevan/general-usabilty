Information architecture is the practice of structuring and organising things in a meaningful way.

For a website or application it's the creation of a structure which allows people to understand where they are, find what they're looking for and successfully achieve any goals.

The process of creating an information architecture crosses many different disciplines including content strategy, design, psychology and research, and involves different techniques including site mapping, wireframing and user journeys.
