<p>Like many design teams, the Wall Street Journal team has been thinking through our design principles. Writing design principles comes pretty naturally (especially if you read this <a href="https://principles.adactio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent list by Jeremy Keith</a>). As we collaborate, we end up with a lot of candidates. However, it’s unclear what exactly a <em>good</em> design principle is.</p>
<p>To that end, here’s a set of criteria I’ve been working with:</p>
<h3 id="good-design-principles-are-memorable.">Good design principles are memorable.</h3>
<p>What good is a design principle if it’s hard to internalize?</p>
<p>✓ <strong>“Good design is as little design as possible”</strong> - <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dieter Rams</a><br>
✕ <strong>“Design with an intention to conserve effort and produce as little material output as is necessary to accomplish your goals”</strong> - Go home, drunk Dieter Rams</p>
<h3 id="good-design-principles-help-you-say-no.">Good design principles help you say no.</h3>
<p>You should be able to use your design principles to prioritize and focus.</p>
<p>✓ <strong>“One primary action per screen”</strong> - <a href="http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joshua Porter</a><br>
✕ <strong>“Keep the number of actions per screen to a minimum”</strong> - It’s hard to say ‘no’ to a vague measure like ‘a minimum.’</p>
<h3 id="good-design-principles-aren%E2%80%99t-truisms.">Good design principles aren’t truisms.</h3>
<p>A good test of truism is the <strong>reversibility test.</strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> A principle passes the test if the opposite of that principle is something a reasonable person might believe.</p>
<p>✓ <strong>“Don’t solve every edge case”</strong> - Look at the opposite: “Solve every edge case.” It’s reasonable for a design organization to take this opposite approach.<br>
✕ <strong>“Make users happy”</strong> - The opposite is: “Make users unhappy.” Nobody in their right mind would think that was a good design principle; thus, “Make users happy” is a truism.</p>
<h3 id="good-design-principles-are-applicable.">Good design principles are applicable.</h3>
<p>They should give everyone on the team ideas of how to best practice them, and they shouldn’t be specific to one particular platform or discipline.</p>
<p>✓ <strong>“Solicit and respect user feedback”</strong> - For any given product (native, web, off-platform) or discipline (ui, ux), it’s possible to get user feedback.<br>
✕ <strong>“Use an 8 pixel grid”</strong> - this is only applicable to screens, and only applicable to ui, and it’s not immediately obvious what exactly an 8-pixel grid is.</p>
<h2 id="a-shortcut-to-good-principles%3A-even-over-statements">A shortcut to good principles: Even Over statements</h2>
<p>Some years ago, I was introduced to the <a href="http://futureofwork.nobl.io/future-of-work/how-to-distill-a-strategy-into-simple-rules-of-thumb-for-busy-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Even Over</a> statement by some close friends and collaborators<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>. Even Over statements are constructed as follows:</p>
<p><strong>(Choice A) even over (Choice B)</strong></p>
<p>“Tastiness even over healthiness” is an example of an Even Over statement that might help you choose what to eat.</p>
<p>“Durability even over style” is an Even Over statement that might help you shop at Ikea.</p>
<p>Both of these Even Over statements pass the <strong>truism test</strong>. Lots of folks choose their furniture based on style, not durability (and pay more for it!); even more folks choose healthiness over tastiness.</p>
<p>Some general design principles that are formatted as Even Over statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility even over aesthetics</li>
<li>Platform conventions even over cross-platform consistency</li>
<li>User preference even over business preference</li>
</ul>
<p>As we continue to refine our principles at WSJ, I hope to use Even Over statements, along with the criteria above, as tools to quickly get to a working foundation.</p>
