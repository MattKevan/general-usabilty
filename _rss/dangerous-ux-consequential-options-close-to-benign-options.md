<p><strong>Summary:</strong>&nbsp;Confirmatory and destructive actions should be far apart from each other; use additional redundant visual signals to differentiate between them and avoid user errors.</p><hr/><br/><p> <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/videos/usability-heuristic-error-prevention/">  Preventing errors </a> is better than helping users <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-control-and-freedom/">  recover </a> from them. That’s an important principle in UX. When users must recover from an error (whether a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-mistakes/">  mistake </a> or a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/slips/">  slip </a> ), they must interrupt their task to devote precious cognitive (and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/working-memory-external-memory/">  working memory </a> ) resources to fixing the problem, even if it’s only for a few seconds. Regardless of how easy it is to access your <em>  Undo </em> function (and we hope you do have one!), it’s better to not have to use it at all.</p><p> Just the other day, as I was typing something in a browser, I got the following spellcheck option:</p><p> Do you notice the potential danger in this otherwise helpful little context menu (and can you guess which option I accidentally clicked due to inaccurate mousing)? Right next to the option to use one of the suggested spellings, there is <em>  Add to Dictionary. </em> Literally, next to the option to fix a mistake is the option to make sure that I will forever make that same mistake! To add insult to injury, these options are very close to each other, so one could easily accidentally click <em>  Add to dictionary </em> while trying to select the suggested correction.</p><br/><br/><a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/proximity-consequential-options/">Read Full Article</a>
