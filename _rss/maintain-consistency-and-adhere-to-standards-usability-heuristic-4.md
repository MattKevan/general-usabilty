<p><strong>Summary:</strong>&nbsp;Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.</p><hr/><br/><p> <em>  Download a free poster of Jakob’s Usability Heuristic #4 at the bottom of this article. </em></p><p> The fourth of Jakob Nielsen’s <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">  ten heuristics </a> — consistency and standards — is key to creating applications that make sense for users.
