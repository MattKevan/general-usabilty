<p><a href="https://baymard.com/blog/use-buttons-for-size-selection" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"><img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-300166-2dce4c25f00202c7878ae8218a127ba2.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /></a></p>



<p>Size is one of the <strong>most common</strong> variations for users to select before purchasing a wide variety of different product types, from apparel to beauty to hardware; all of the sites in our <a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark">UX benchmark</a> of the top-60 e-commerce sites have different size options for at least some of their products.</p>



<p>During our large-scale <a href="https://baymard.com/research">UX testing</a>, we observed that, when presented as a drop-down menu, users during testing were prone to <strong>overlook</strong> the size selector entirely.</p>



<p>Additionally, when they did activate the menu, they were often <strong>surprised or disappointed</strong> by the sizes available.</p>



<p>Despite the issues demonstrated by drop-down size selectors, 28% of desktop <a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark">benchmark sites</a> that sell many products with size variations <strong>continue</strong> to use them.</p>



<p>In practice, some users who overlook the size selector risk triggering an <strong>avoidable error message.</strong></p>



<p>Other users must check to see if their size is available for each variation under consideration — a potentially tedious task that often leads to users simply <strong>giving up.</strong></p>



<p>In this article we’ll discuss the <strong>test findings</strong> from our mobile and desktop <a href="https://baymard.com/research">UX research</a> related to the display of size selectors on product pages. In particular, we’ll cover:</p>



<ul>
  <li>The risks we observed during testing when sizes were presented within a drop-down menu</li>
  <li>The benefits of displaying sizes as “buttons” instead of within a drop-down</li>
  <li>How to display size “buttons” when there are an abundance of size options available — even on a small mobile screen</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://baymard.com/blog/use-buttons-for-size-selection" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"><img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-300168-a13a27715062be0fe1283e6dd9c4b90e.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /></a></p>



<p>When size options are located within a drop-down menu, they are essentially <strong>hidden by default</strong> until users interact with them.</p>



<p>During Baymard’s large-scale <a href="https://baymard.com/research">usability testing</a> across desktop and mobile, we repeatedly observed users spending considerable time and effort exploring a product, only to be disappointed when they opened the size drop-down selector to discover it was <strong>out of stock</strong> in their preferred size — and that their time had been wasted.</p>



<p>In fact, we’ve observed <strong>similar issues</strong> not only for color and size selectors on the product details page, but also for <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/drop-down-usability">drop-down menus</a> within <a href="https://www.baymard.com/blog/current-state-of-checkout-ux">Checkout</a> and <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/truncation-design">filtering product lists</a>.</p>



<p>In effect, users are less able to find, review, and understand their choices, increasing the likelihood of <strong>wasted effort</strong> and error.</p>



<p><a href="https://baymard.com/blog/use-buttons-for-size-selection" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"><img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-300169-f5177e153178c285c9c330dd55370730.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /></a></p>



<p><a href="https://baymard.com/blog/use-buttons-for-size-selection" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"><img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-300170-6a91fbc29788df9c631f7930ec97aef7.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /></a></p>



<p>What’s more, while the majority of users during both desktop and mobile testing eventually found size variations when presented within a drop-down menu, a significant subgroup <strong>overlooked</strong> the size drop-down menu altogether — even when placed near or within the “Buy” section, where it should have been easily visible.</p>



<p>In most cases, these users will trigger an avoidable error message, which presents a <strong>speed bump</strong> in their buying process. After receiving the error message, they typically then notice the size drop-down and make a selection, recovering relatively quickly.</p>



<p><a href="https://baymard.com/blog/use-buttons-for-size-selection" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"><img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-300171-167b8b240b892eb85dcb225f3f172e0c.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /></a></p>



<p>However, some sites have a default preselected size for products — for example, a 39 x 27 inch poster size selected by default — which enables users to add a product to the cart <strong>without reviewing</strong> and selecting the size option at all on the product page.</p>



<p>While some users may catch themselves before they complete the purchase, there’s a risk that some <strong>won’t notice</strong> this fact — completing checkout and purchasing a product that was not in their preferred size.</p>



<p>Naturally, this experience can have long-lasting effects, and result in users <strong>negatively perceiving</strong> a site for some time to come, if not permanently.</p>



<p>(Of course, in practice, this kind of purchasing mistake is more likely for product types where users aren’t necessarily aware of or thinking about sizes when they arrive on the product page — for example, users may not immediately realize that different sizes are available for products like posters or backpacks, but are generally aware they will have to select a size for products like footwear and apparel.)</p>



<p><a href="https://baymard.com/blog/use-buttons-for-size-selection" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"><img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-300172-afa522cd27e54bc934fea2d1ad540e76.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /></a></p>



<p>On <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/mobile-commerce-design">mobile</a>, this increased need for interaction becomes <strong>even more tedious</strong>, especially when products come in multiple color or style variations in addition to multiple sizes.</p>



<p>Due to the size of the mobile viewport, product information is <strong>squeezed</strong> into a narrower and longer-scrolling format, forcing users to scroll back-and-forth between the <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/mobile-interactive-color-swatches">color selector</a> and size selector in order to determine the availability of each combination.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, on desktop, the more expansive viewport typically allows even abundant color, size, and other variations to be visible within a single screen, making the process for selecting a combination of product options <strong>less labor intensive.</strong></p>



<p>When there are more than a handful of color variations, some users are likely to <strong>give up</strong> on finding their preferred color and size combination, deeming it too time-consuming.</p>



<h2 id="exposed-buttons-allow-users-to-immediately-see-size-options">Exposed “Buttons” Allow Users to Immediately See Size Options</h2>



<p><a href="https://baymard.com/blog/use-buttons-for-size-selection" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"><img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-300183-851f9e5e59c707d5cde64529edb2b930.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /></a></p>



<p><a href="https://baymard.com/blog/use-buttons-for-size-selection" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"><img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-300184-59aa21cd92e7c883ae3fc0ea61aff989.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /></a></p>



<p>Instead of using a drop-down with the size options hidden by default, exposing the size options by using button-like selectors helps to ensure that these crucial product variations are <strong>easily seen</strong> by users.</p>



<p>With each button representing a size, users are better able to see <strong>at a glance</strong> all of the available options, and the amount of effort and interaction required to learn this basic information is greatly diminished.</p>



<p>As one user noted, <em>“I think the least amount of clicks I have to do, the better”.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://baymard.com/blog/use-buttons-for-size-selection" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"><img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-300185-dd54c54299281908d4be69f53eb84acd.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /></a></p>



<p><a href="https://baymard.com/blog/use-buttons-for-size-selection" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"><img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-300177-bd74daffbfb77d66404dfcc5b19da904.jpg" style="width:500px;height:auto;" alt="" width="500" height="auto" /></a></p>



<p>Of course, once exposed, the selectors should be designed so that it’s clear which size is <strong>currently selected</strong>.</p>



<p>During testing, we observed some designs were much <strong>too subtle</strong> in indicating which size had been selected.</p>



<p>Selectors that are too inconspicuous, and selection indications that are too subdued, will <strong>slow users down</strong>, as they have to first determine if the system has recognized their input before they can move on to adding it to their cart.</p>



<p>Additionally, on mobile, size buttons that are not adequately sized and spaced can also lead to frustrating <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/list-items-hover-and-hit-area">hit area</a> issues, making it more difficult for users to <strong>accurately target</strong> the correct size. As with other mobile elements, ensuring size selectors are appropriately designed for touch interaction is vital.</p>



<h2 id="buttons-are-a-better-experience-even-when-there-are-an-abundance-of-choices">“Buttons” Are a Better Experience, Even When There Are an Abundance of Choices</h2>


<p>Products that come in a <strong>wide variety</strong> of sizes present a special challenge when providing individual buttons for each size variation, as they can easily take up a large proportion of the viewport — especially on mobile.</p>



<p><a href="https://baymard.com/blog/use-buttons-for-size-selection" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"><img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-300186-c0512e671b85eff791c2e99d0885935c.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /></a></p>



<p>On desktop, the more <strong>expansive</strong> screen real estate can typically accommodate a large array of size selectors, assuming they’re not overly large.</p>



<p><a href="https://baymard.com/blog/use-buttons-for-size-selection" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"><img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-300179-9510037fcec60a051dfec0a67ae40289.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /></a></p>



<p>When there are a wide variety of size options, consider grouping and <strong>nesting sizes</strong> by type (e.g., <em>“Regular”</em> versus <em>“Plus”</em> sizes, <em>“Standard”</em> versus <em>“Long”</em> inseam), which allows individual sizes within each type to be available directly on the page without the need to activate and scroll through a drop-down.</p>



<p>This implementation is particularly vital to limit the amount of scrolling on narrow mobile screens.</p>



<p>Note however that a “nested size selectors” design was not tested, and thus sites should proceed cautiously if implementing.</p>



<p><a href="https://baymard.com/blog/use-buttons-for-size-selection" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"><img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-300187-c7c65342b755116a51c8d8db50672980.jpg" style="width:500px;height:auto;" alt="" width="500" height="auto" /></a></p>



<p>Additionally, a <strong>horizontal swipeable list</strong> can be used on mobile to further reduce the screen real estate taken up by the size selector, taking advantage of users’ familiarity with this design pattern for other <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/implementing-mobile-hierarchy-breadcrumbs">mobile features</a>.</p>



<h2 id="size-buttons-have-become-a-standard-web-convention">Size “Buttons” Have Become a Standard Web Convention</h2>



<p><a href="https://baymard.com/blog/use-buttons-for-size-selection" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"><img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-300188-38fe52dd5acdf76cb8f7374b7e5d2e5f.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /></a></p>



<p>For products that come in different sizes, previewing which ones are <strong>in stock</strong> is an essential prerequisite for making the decision to purchase.</p>



<p><a href="https://baymard.com/blog/drop-down-usability">Drop-down menus</a>, broadly speaking, are oftentimes a <strong>relic</strong> of early web design that predates modern users’ familiarity and comfort with exposed selections like <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/mobile-interactive-color-swatches">color swatches</a>.</p>



<p>Without the clarity of modern “button” size selectors, users may overlook their ideal color and size combination, <strong>abandoning their purchase</strong> without realizing the possibilities hidden within variations drop-downs.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the effortless information provided by size “buttons” presents a clear <strong>usability improvement</strong> over presenting size options within drop-down menus — which helps to account for size “buttons’” increasing popularity: 71% of current desktop <a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark">benchmark sites</a> appropriately use size “buttons”, up from 63% in 2017.</p>



<p>It’s therefore crucial to <strong>meet users’ expectations</strong> with regards to how size selectors will be presented on the product page — or risk users leaving, despite there being a perfect size available in the variation they desire.</p>



<p>(Tip: see <a href="https://baymard.com/product-page/benchmark/page-designs/product-page">239 examples of product pages</a> showing how many of our benchmark sites use size “buttons”.)</p>
