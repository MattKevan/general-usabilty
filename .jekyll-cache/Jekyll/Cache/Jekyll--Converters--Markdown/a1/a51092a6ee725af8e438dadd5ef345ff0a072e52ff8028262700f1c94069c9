<h3 id="100-accurate-data">100% Accurate Data</h3>

<p><strong>Did you know accurate data reporting is often capped?</strong>Meaning once your website traffic reaches a certain limit, the data then becomes a guess rather than factual.</p>

<p>This is where tools like Google Analytics becomes extremely limited and cashes in with their GA360 Premium suite. At Matomo, we believe all data should be reported 100% accurately, or else whatâ€™s the point?</p>

<p><strong>Take the challenge:</strong> Compare your Google Analytics data (sampled data) against your Matomo data.</p>
