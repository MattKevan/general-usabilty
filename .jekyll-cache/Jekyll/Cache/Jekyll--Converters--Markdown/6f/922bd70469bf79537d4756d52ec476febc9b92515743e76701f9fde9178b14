<p>Eye-tracking has a long history. From hardware to software, to SaaS. Now design screens in a project are infinite, iterations are becoming faster, and there is no time in design teams to validate their pixels every time with eye-tracking sessions.</p>

<p>This is why we create predictive design models, showing you where your users will look at your designs in a fraction of a second.</p>
