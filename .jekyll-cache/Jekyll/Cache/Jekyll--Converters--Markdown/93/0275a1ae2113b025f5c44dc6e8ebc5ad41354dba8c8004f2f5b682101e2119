I"~<p>We’re a centre of excellence in digital, technology and data, collaborating with departments to help them with their own transformation. We work with them to build platforms, standards, and digital services.</p>

<p>We always start with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs.html">user needs</a>. We are <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/06/30/outcomes-not-deliverables/">agile</a>. We work to a set of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles">Design Principles</a> that guide us in everything we do.</p>

<p>We believe in working openly, because <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#tenth">making things open makes them better</a>.</p>

<p>We run <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>, the best place to find government services and information. It began as an alpha, <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2011/07/29/alpha-gov-uk-wrap-up/">built in just 10 weeks</a>, and has grown to become <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/11/20/2-billion-and-counting/">part of our national digital infrastructure</a>. It’s always being improved in response to user research and user feedback.</p>
