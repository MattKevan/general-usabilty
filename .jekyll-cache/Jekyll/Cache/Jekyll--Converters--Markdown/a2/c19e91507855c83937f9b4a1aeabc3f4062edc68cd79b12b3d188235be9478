<p>Each contributor owns their part of the creative process and stays in sync along the wayâ€”across any platform.</p>

<h4 id="your-designers">Your designers</h4>

<p>Collaborate in context and in real time. Never worry about your files being out of date or overwriting each otherâ€™s work.</p>

<h4 id="your-stakeholders">Your stakeholders</h4>

<p>Simply send a link to collect feedback, get change requests, and allow stakeholders to make copy updates in your designs.</p>

<h4 id="your-developers">Your developers</h4>

<p>Engineers always have access to the current source-of-truth and can inspect elements, export assets, and copy code.</p>

<h3 id="increase-efficiency-with-added-flexibility">Increase efficiency with added flexibility</h3>

<h4 id="team-libraries">Team Libraries</h4>

<p>Share components and styles in Figmaâ€”no need for shared drives or additional tools. You and your team control how and when changes are rolled out with simple publishing workflows.</p>

<h4 id="components">Components</h4>

<p>Build faster and more consistently with reusable and scalable elements across your files. Access layers in each instance so you can intuitively edit and override text and images inline.</p>

<h4 id="styles">Styles</h4>

<p>Synchronize colors, text, grids and effects across all your projects. Maintain fewer text styles and align your designs across different devices with Figmaâ€™s unique grid styles.</p>

<h4 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h4>

<p>Quickly build flows by connecting screens and adding in elements like interactions, transitions, overlays, and more. Instead of syncing to other tools simply share a URL to receive feedback.</p>

<h3 id="build-design-systems-that-scale">Build design systems that scale</h3>

<p>Manage and easily share a consistent visual language with styles, components, and team libraries.</p>
