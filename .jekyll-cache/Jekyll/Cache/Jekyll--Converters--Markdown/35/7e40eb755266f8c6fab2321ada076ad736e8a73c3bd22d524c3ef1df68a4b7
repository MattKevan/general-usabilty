I"²<p>Iâ€™m not here to tell you that typography is more important than the substance of your writing. Itâ€™sÂ not.</p>

<p>But typography can enhance your writing. Typography can create a better first impression. Typography can reinforce your key points. Typography can extend reader attention. When you ignore typography, youâ€™re ignoring an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of your writing.</p>

<p>And isnâ€™t that why you write at all? To have an effect on readers? To move them, to persuade them, to spur them to action?</p>

<p>If so, then you should want what typography has to offer. Best of all, itâ€™s fast and itâ€™s easy. Unlike, say, learning to be a better writer.</p>
