I"3<p>I’ve designed digital products for the past 15 years. I’ve worked mainly in-house for big old banks like Merrill Lynch, UBS, Lloyds Banking Group with a few Fintechs and startups in between.</p>

<p>Designing financial products is a curious fit. I don’t wear a suit and I’m not that hot on spreadsheets. What gets me excited is creating products that positively affect people’s lives. Over the years I’ve met a lot of humans and listened to their problems. I’ve designed tools and services to help these folks improve their financial health.</p>
