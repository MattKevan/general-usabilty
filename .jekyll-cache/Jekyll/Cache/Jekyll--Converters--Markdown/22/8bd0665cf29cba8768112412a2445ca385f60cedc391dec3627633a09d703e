I"á<p>We make inaccessible and unusable websites and apps all the time, but it‚Äôs not for lack of skill or talent. It‚Äôs just a case of doing things the wrong way. We try to build the best experiences we can, but we only make them for ourselves and for people like us.</p>

<p>This book looks at common interface patterns from the perspective of an inclusive designer‚Äîsomeone trained in building experiences that cater to the huge diversity of abilities, preferences and circumstances out there.</p>
