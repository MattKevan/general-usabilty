### Actionable insights for every team

Elevate your perspective. Diagram anything—ideas, information, and processes—to drive better decisions in every area of your business.

### Yes, you should diagram

Anyone, in any industry and any role, can use Lucidchart. After all, everyone has been drawing out ideas since childhood. We make it easy to create powerful visuals to improve how you do business. Get a head start with over 500 templates, or drag and drop from our shape library to customize your diagram.

### Make diagrams smarter with data

When you know, you can act. Bring together diagrams and data visualization to create an actionable view. Import data from Excel, Zapier, Salesforce, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, and more, or use automated layout to generate a diagram from data.

### Build a shared perspective

Real-time collaboration gives your business an edge. Now you can get everyone on the same page even if they’re on different devices or operating systems. Work together and receive feedback quickly, whether your co-workers are in the same office or spread across the world.

### Works where you work

Enrich your existing applications when you integrate Lucidchart with leading productivity platforms such as G Suite, Atlassian, Slack, Salesforce, and Microsoft Office. With support across all major operating systems and native mobile apps, you can always move your business forward.
