### Deliver robust UIs

Storybook provides a sandbox to build UI components in isolation so you can develop hard-to-reach states and edge cases.  
  
**Build components in isolation**

Create components without needing to stand up screens, fuss with data, or build business logic.

**Mock hard to reach use cases**

Render components in key states that are tricky to reproduce in an app.

**Document use cases as stories**

Save use cases as stories in plain JavaScript to revisit during development, testing, and QA.

**Supercharge your workflow with addons**

Use addons to build UI faster, document a component library, and streamline your workflow.

### Ship components with confidence

Storybook makes it easy to keep track of edge cases and as a result you get tests for free.

**Ensure consistent user experiences**

Whenever you write a story you get a handy visual spec. Quickly browse stories to make sure your UI looks right.

**Auto-detect code regressions**

Get code snapshot tests out of the box with Storyshots, an official addon.

**Unit test components**

Reuse stories in your unit tests to confirm nuanced functionality.

**Catch UI changes down to the pixel every commit**

Pinpoint UI changes with visual testing tools.

### Share and reuse everything

Stop reinventing the wheel. Get a birds-eye view of your UI library to find components to reuse in your project.

**Find any component in your app**

Storybook is a searchable, single source of truth for your UI components.

**Get timely feedback during development**

Collaborate on UI implementation with your team by deploying Storybook to the cloud.

**Share components across screens and apps**

Every story is a use case that your team can find and reuse.

**Generate a styleguide automatically**

Write Markdown/MDX to generate a customizable site that is perfect for component libraries and design systems.
