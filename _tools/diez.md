### Design Token Components

Use TypeScript to compose design tokens into deeply customizable, reusable, and developer-friendly Design Token Components.

Design Token Components enable a "write once, use anywhere" paradigm for your design language, across codebases.

### Cross-Platform Native Compiler

More precisely a _transpiler_: Diez builds your TypeScript component definitions into pure native SDKs for iOS, Android, and the Web — complete with type definitions and autocomplete.

**Diez works with your codebase(s):** Diez carries zero opinions about rendering, requires no runtime or VMs, and is designed for progressive adoption.

### Design File Extractors

Diez includes command-line tools for extracting normalized, strongly typed styles and images from many modern design tools.

### Hot Updates

The Diez compiler ships with a `**hot**` mode, which allows for hot updates at development time — even inside native iOS and Android apps.
