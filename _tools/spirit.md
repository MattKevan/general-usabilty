### Spirit Studio

Spirit Studio uses keyframes, just like other industry-standard animation tools. Simply change an element attribute, set a keyframe, rinse and repeat. It's that easy!

### Live edit

Edit your animations live in the browser and see changes immediately. Consider Spirit as the WYSIWYG editor for web animations. Animating is fun again, seriously.

### Play / control

Spirit Studio exports animation data and comes with a web player to control and play your created animations in production. Lightweight and extremely powerful.

### Live Edit

It's almost plug and play, simply connect Spirit Studio to any webpage, add elements to your animation and start animating in real time.

### No Code Required

With Spirit Studio you can visually compose your animations, whether you know how to code or not. Focus on the aesthetics and timing of your animation.

### Iterate

You can fine-tune your animations anytime and in every detail, simply (re)connect a web page and edit your animations. Yes, even in production.

### Next

As Spirit originated to be a web animation tool, we are working hard to make Spirit available for other platforms.
