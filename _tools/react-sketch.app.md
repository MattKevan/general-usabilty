#### Why?!

Managing the assets of design systems in Sketch is complex, error-prone and time consuming. 

Sketch is scriptable, but the API often changes. React provides the perfect wrapper to build reusable documents in a way already familiar to JavaScript developers.

#### What can I do with it?

* **Manage design systems—** `react-sketchapp` was built for [Airbnb’s design system](http://airbnb.design/building-a-visual-language/); this is the easiest way to manage Sketch assets in a large design system.
* **Use real components for designs—** Implement your designs in code as React components and render them into Sketch
* **Design with real data—** Designing with data is important but challenging; `react-sketchapp` makes it simple to fetch and incorporate real data into your Sketch files.
* **Build new tools on top of Sketch—** the easiest way to use Sketch as a canvas for custom design tooling.
