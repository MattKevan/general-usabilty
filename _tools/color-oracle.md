Color Oracle is It takes the guesswork out of designing for color blindness by showing you in real time what people with common color vision impairments will see.  
  
Color Oracle applies a full screen color filter to art you are designing, independently of the software in use. Eight percent of all males are affected by color vision impairment â€“ make sure that your graphical work is readable by the widest possible audience.
