### If you can link to it – you can test it

Test an array of live websites, those under development, early prototypes or even your competitor’s sites on either smartphones, desktops or tablets.

If it has an URL, you can test it. No code installation is needed and the setup is done in minutes.

### Continuously capture insights and make user testing a routine
