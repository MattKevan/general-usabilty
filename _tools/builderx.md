### Beautiful, readable & production-ready code

Designers and developers on one platform

#### Teams & share via link

Built something amazing? Share it with the team! Be it a developer or someone who you want to share your progress with, the projects can be shared by a simple link.

#### Sketch to React Native!

Seamlessly convert Sketch designs to React Native & React

#### Flex layout

Developers like it Flex. Designers like it Absolute. Though BuilderX tries to automatically convert Absolute to Flex, you can specifically define Flex Layouts in BuilderX.

#### Component export

Take what you need. Not every developer is a fan of the folder structure we generate. So why compromise? Just export the parts what you like as Components.

#### Component library
