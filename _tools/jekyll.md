### Simple

No more databases, comment moderation, or pesky updates to install—just _your content_.

### Static

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki), HTML & CSS go in. Static sites come out ready for deployment.

### Blog-aware

Permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts are all first-class citizens here.

### Free hosting with GitHub Pages

Sick of dealing with hosting companies? [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are _powered by Jekyll_, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free—[custom domain name](https://help.github.com/articles/about-supported-custom-domains/) and all.
