#### Why?

The motivation behind this project was ability to easily share Front-End style guide with our Design team. Although similar project, [react-sketchapp](https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp), already exists it does require you to:

* use React,
* build everything using generic components (`<View>`, `<Text>`, `<Image>`),
* and keep your styles in JS.

We were unable to quickly work around these limitations, so we created html-sketchapp.

You can learn more about this project from:

* and the excellent article ["Sketching in the Browser"](https://medium.com/seek-blog/sketching-in-the-browser-33a7b7aa0526) by @markdalgleish.
