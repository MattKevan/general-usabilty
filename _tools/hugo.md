#### Blistering Speed

What's modern about waiting for your site to build? Hugo is the fastest tool of its kind. At <1 ms per page, the average site builds in less than a second.

#### Robust Content Management

Flexibility rules. Hugo is a content strategist's dream. Hugo supports unlimited content types, taxonomies, menus, dynamic API-driven content, and more, all without plugins.

#### Shortcodes

Hugo's shortcodes are Markdown's hidden superpower. We love the beautiful simplicity of markdownâ€™s syntax, but there are times when we want more flexibility. Hugo shortcodes allow for both beauty and flexibility.

#### Built-in Templates

Hugo has common patterns to get your work done quickly. Hugo ships with pre-made templates to make quick work of SEO, commenting, analytics and other functions. One line of code, and you're done.

#### Multilingual and internationalisation

Polyglot baked in. Hugo provides full i18n support for multi-language sites with the same straightforward development experience Hugo users love in single-language sites.
