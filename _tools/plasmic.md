### Build maintainable, production-ready presentational components at the speed of design.

Plasmic enables developers and designers to compose React UIs visually. It lets you start with rough designs from Figma/Sketch or from scratch, and refactor them into maintainable, production-ready presentational componentsâ€”without compromising developer control. 

You can import Plasmic components into your existing React codebase, and you can also reuse existing code components in the Plasmic editor. 

With Plasmic, the aim is to provide a better and faster development experience, eliminate an entire class of visual bugs/QA/tooling, and ultimately maintain a single source of truth with design.
