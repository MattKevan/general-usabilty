### All your Sketch files in one place

No more hunting through shared folders. Abstract is a safe home for your Sketch design and library files, a single source of truth for your design team’s work.

### Version control for Sketch files

Stop relying on creative file-naming conventions. Abstract removes the friction of managing your team’s growing Sketch design files. It’s not just version control; it’s source control you can trust.

### No more conflicted copies

Work on the same set of Sketch files without losing anyone’s work. Abstract allows multiple designers to work on the same file without fearing overwritten changes.booklink
