### Data without the downsides

Better accuracy, better performance, and better privacy for your users. A one-click install with no scripts required on your websites. We really like these trends.

#### Data right from the source of truth

Most 3rd-party analytics programs need tracking pixels, JavaScript and cookies to keep count of visitors. But Netlify Analytics is fueled by server-side data collected directly from our worldwide edge nodes—without requiring any code running on the client. That means we can provide more accurate data, right from our server logs, with zero impact to the performance of your site or the privacy of your users.

#### Better performance

Netlify Analytics will never impact the render time of your web applications since the work of capturing requests happens on our infrastructure, not in the browser. There’s nothing to add to your code; nothing to be downloaded by your visitors. It just works, silently and reliably, without any impact to page performance.
