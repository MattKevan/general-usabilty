### Flexible

Complete freedom to use whichever templating language, build tool and organisational model best suits your project.

### Integrated

Seamlessly integrate your component library into your site, app or build tools by including it as a dependency in your build.

### Data-driven

Component preview data can be hardcoded or dynamically generated any way you like - for instance using libraries such as Faker.
