### Collaborate Anywhere

Mind mapping in a team setting has never been easier. MindMeister lets you share your mind maps with as many friends or colleagues as you want and collaborate with them in real-time. Whether you're in a face-to-face meeting or thousands of miles apart, everyone can see changes made in the mind map immediately. Collaborators can quickly comment on topics, vote on ideas or discuss changes in our integrated chat.

### Stunning Presentations

Visualizing your ideas is the most powerful way to communicate them to others. With MindMeister's built-in presentation mode you turn mind maps into beautiful, dynamic slideshows within seconds. As soon as you're done you can export the slides as PNGs, embed the whole presentation on your website, or even broadcast it live to your collaborators online.

### Simple Project Management

MindMeister seamlessly integrates with MeisterTask, the intuitive online task and project management app for teams. As soon as you've completed the brainstorming and planning phase in MindMeister, you can simply drag and drop your ideas into a connected MeisterTask project, where they are turned into actionable tasks.
