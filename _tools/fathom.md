Over 1 million people use our software to know what’s important and popular on their websites, all from a single, blazingly-fast dashboard.

Stop scrolling through pages of reports and collecting gobs of personal data about your visitors, both of which you probably don’t need. Fathom is a simple and private website analytics platform that lets you focus on what's important: your business.

### One screen, in real-time

Our analytics platform isn’t infinite pages of reports and screens—everything is available on a single, well designed screen. Get what you need, then move on with your day.

### Cookie notices not required

We don’t collect personal or invasive data about your users, nor do we use cookies, meaning you don’t have to show pesky notices to users about cookie tracking. We’re GDPR compliant too.

### Grows without slowing you down

Our on-demand, auto-scaling servers will never slow your site down. Our tracker file is served via our super-fast CDN, with endpoints located around the world to ensure fast page loads.

### Instantly ready for huge spikes

Our software is built to handle billions of page views, so huge traffic spikes are tracked easily and don’t ever slow down your site. Our fair pricing model protects you from big bills for occasional overages.
