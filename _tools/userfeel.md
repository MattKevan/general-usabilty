Userfeel was designed and developed by Usability Researchers for Usability Researchers but also for newcomers to UX Research and anyone who wants to optimize their website or app.

### Userfeel is a multilingual user testing tool

Test any site in any language. Our panel consists of more than 70,000 testers speaking 40 languages. You can even have testers provide comments in your language while testing a website that is in a language you don't understand.

### User testing on any device

Test on desktop, mobile, or tablet. Testing with both our app and an external camera allows us to test websites or applications on Android, iPhone, or iPad.
