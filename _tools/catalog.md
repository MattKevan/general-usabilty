Simple Editing

Catalog makes creating and maintaining a style guide as simple as editing plain text files with your favorite editor. Using Markdown formatting allows you to write gorgeous content using an easy-to-learn syntax.

### Beautiful Presentation

Catalog is designed from the ground up to put your design system into the right light. The clean and simple design works beautifully across devices and screen sizes.

### Direct Integration

Catalog integrates right with React applications and displays live components and code snippets in your style guide. So you can stop the copy-and-paste madness.

### Zero Lock-in

Catalog is open source and free to use, making it possible for you to add, maintain, or replace it depending on your changing requirements.

### Versatile

Catalog does not enforce any specific taxonomy or structure: Build upon established principles, like Atomic Design, or run your very own pattern language.

### Extensible & Customizable

Catalog is built using a modular architecture. It can be extended with your own plugins and customized to fit your needs.
