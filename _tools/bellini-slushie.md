### Most tools don't make you a better researcher

This is not another survey platform. There are plenty out there.

There are also a million online resources with sample questions, question types, response options, and reasons to ask questions.

A million bits and pieces, scattered all over the internet.

**Everytime you build a survey, it’s an epic scavenger hunt.**

On the internet. In your old files. In colleague's minds.

That’s where the Bellini Slushie **Survey Question Bank**comes in.

### Search

Find questions that have relevant responses and are contextualized to culture. The database is organised with category tags, languages and countries so you can fly through it.

### Discover

Browse through our catalog of survey questions. They’re paired with best practices and execution tips, so you can understand when and why you should or shouldn’t use them.

### Assemble

Jump-start your survey with **free** questions, available for your immediate use. We’re platform agnostic, so you can still use your favorite tools.

### Contribute

Join us on our mission to make research better. We're keeping this open-source and community-oriented, so anyone can add questions and translations to the database.
