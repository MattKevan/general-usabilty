On average, only 43.9% of all ad impressions across the Web are considered ‘viewable’.

## Strategies to increase viewability

### Improve page speed

The faster a page loads, the more time a user has to see the adverts before they scroll or navigate away.

### Lazy-load adverts

This ensures adverts are only served when users can see them, reducing the number of adverts loaded but not viewed.

### Use responsive adverts

Responsive adverts are scaled appropriately to the size of display used to view them, increasing the viewability rates.

### Optimise page layout

Changing and optimising placements on the page can increase viewability rates.

**Above the fold** – The most viewable position for a banner advert is just above the 'fold', or further down the page as it remains in-view for longer as a user scrolls. This is in contrast to its ususal  position which is above the header.

**Sticky banner** – Fix the banner while scrolling past the header, then un-fix when reaching the page content, keeping it on screen for longer. Header height may need to be adjusted for a longer scroll.

**Sticky sidebar** - Fix the ad in place for a second or so while the user scrolls.

**Peek** – On page load ‘peek’ the banner up from the bottom of the page for a second or two.

**Rich content** – Surround adverts with rich content. Adverts will remain viewable for longer as user consumes the content.
