title: UX Paradigms
author: Audi
overview: The Audi brand is not only defined by its visual appearance. When it comes to interactive channels the question also has to be asked\:\ what defines interaction with the brand across all applications and devices? We set ourselves the goal of making interaction as simple and as positive as possible for our customers so that the experience is associated with the brand, thereby supporting lasting loyalty. On the path to achieving this goal, the UX paradigms provide a shared basis for developing new ideas and striving for constant improvement.
