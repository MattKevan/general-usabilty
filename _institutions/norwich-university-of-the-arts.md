Norwich University of the Arts (NUA) has established itself in arts, design and media education for over 170 years. But while our history can be traced back to 1845, our outlook is forward-thinking.

From a city centre campus that boasts cutting-edge facilities, to an approach to teaching which saw us awarded Gold under the Teaching Excellence Framework and ranked 10th in the UK for teaching quality by _The Times_ and _The Sunday Times Good University Guide 2018_, our reputation for excellence is well-earned.

NUA has thrived as an established University, developing a national reputation as an innovative and creative academic community, with a firm commitment to offering vocational, practice based courses that afford students space to develop their skills and pursue their passion.

At the heart of it all, our students. Artists, designers, makers. Bringing diverse interests and unique perspectives, they share a desire to be challenged and inspired. To learn from the past and shape the future.
