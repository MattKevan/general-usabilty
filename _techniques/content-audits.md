A content audit means creating an inventory of all the content in a site, including pages and linked assets such as images and PDFs.

This can help inform the scale of the redesign task, and combined with user research or analytics, can help indicate where to prioritise resources or effort. For example, if analytics show that 40% of content has not been viewed, a decision can be made as to whether it's actually necessary that those pages are be migrated to the new site.
