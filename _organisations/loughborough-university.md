That’s why we have been named University of the Year at the Whatuni? Student Choice Awards 2020. The Awards are based on reviews and ratings made by current students across the UK, so winning this award shows that our students are extremely satisfied with the services and experience we provide them with.

This isn’t the first time we’ve won the prestigious accolade either. We were also named University of the Year by the WhatUni? Awards in 2015 and again in 2018. We’ve also been named University of the Year in the Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide twice.
