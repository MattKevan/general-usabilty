### A bit about NUX

We’re a group of enthusiasts who like to get together to talk about anything and everything to do with the user experience – sharing knowledge, sparking ideas and supporting each other.

We’re non-charging, non-profiteering, non-egomaniacal, friendly, normal people who like informal, sociable meetings that give us something to think about.

### Come along to…

…our regular monthly and bi-monthly meetings. They are held in cities up and down the M62: Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Newcastle and our newest group in York.

These meetings are completely free and open to anyone who’s interested in user experience, whatever work you do or discipline you study. And if you’d like to speak at one, you’re very welcome – we want to encourage as many people as possible to take part.

### Why not try our…

…[NUX conference](http://nuxconf.uk/). Our annual conference is growing in numbers and in influence – we run it right here in the North, finding national and international speakers who want to share what they have learned. It’s big and exciting, and it’s just as friendly as our monthly get-togethers
