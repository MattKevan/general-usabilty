<p>After reading <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/management-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lara Hogan’s post</a> and getting some inspiration from my own manager, I thought it’d be good to write up my management philosophy. This reflects my approach at this moment in time — I’m still pretty new to management, and will be revisiting this over time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="my-philosophy">My Philosophy</h2>
<p>I believe in servant leadership. If I do my job well, the people I manage will excel in their role and grow in their career.</p>
<p>I also believe that everyone defines success differently. I’m always seeking to tune and improve my management practices to best support those that I coach.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-expect-of-those-who-report-to-me">What I expect of those who report to me</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Come to our 1-on-1 with your full attention, and be as candid as you can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build relationships across teams. Your connections with your peers in other parts of the organization will help you excel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay curious. Use our resources (in-house training, education budget, etc) to grow your skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share your work. Regularly seek feedback from other designers, and post to public channels when it’s appropriate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-my-reports-can-expect-from-me">What my reports can expect from me</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A weekly 1-on-1, with my undivided attention. I prefer to use 1-on-1s as an opportunity for you to share thoughts with me, or solicit my contributions if you choose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regular skip-level 1-on-1s with my manager. The cadence will depend on their availability, and I’ll make sure any exceptions are accommodated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>360 reviews every four months. In addition to the company-mandated annual review, I’ll regularly share feedback from myself, your peers, and your stakeholders on how you’re performing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respect for work/life balance. I won’t send you messages (Slack or email) outside of working hours. If the need arises, I’ll make it clear why the circumstances are unusual.</p>
</li>
</ul>
