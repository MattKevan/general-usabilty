<p><strong>Summary:</strong>&nbsp;Livestreams allow users to see products in detail and get their questions answered in real time. They can be integrated in ecommerce websites and on social-networking apps.</p><hr/><br/><p> <strong>  Livestream ecommerce </strong> is a business model in which retailers, influencers, or celebrities sell products and services via online video streaming where the presenter demonstrates and discusses the offering and answers audience questions in real-time.
