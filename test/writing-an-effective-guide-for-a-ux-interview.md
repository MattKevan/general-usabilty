<p><strong>Summary:</strong>&nbsp;Preparing a guide for a user interview ensures that topics relevant to your research questions are covered, and that the interview captures in-depth information about people’s lives and needs.</p><hr/><br/><p> In the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/discovery-phase/">  discovery phase </a> of product development, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-interviews/">  user interviews </a> are often used to capture important information about users: their backgrounds, beliefs, motivations, desires, or needs. Typically, the interviews carried out at this stage are <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/videos/3-types-user-interviews/">  semistructured </a> (referred to as “depth interviews” by market researchers) — they generally have a predefined structure, but also allow the interviewer the flexibility to follow up on significant statements made by participants.</p><p> In a semistructured interview, the interviewer uses an interview guide (also referred to as a discussion guide). Unlike an interview script — which is used in <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/videos/3-types-user-interviews/">  structured interviews </a> — an interview guide can be used flexibly: interviewers can ask questions in any order they see fit, omit questions, or ask questions that are not in the guide.</p><p> A good interview guide paves the way for a deep, free-flowing conversation with participants. (Obviously, the way you conduct the interview will also be important, but that’s another article!) Interview guides should include a few concise, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/open-ended-questions/">  open-ended questions </a> to encourage participants to tell their stories. These will be followed by carefully crafted, probing questions to uncover motivations or beliefs behind certain reported behaviors or utterances.</p><br/><br/><a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/interview-guide/">Read Full Article</a>
