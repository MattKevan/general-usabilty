In this article, we’ve consolidated the advice into 27 tips relevant not only to those getting started with journey mapping, but to all practitioners who want to learn from their peers’ knowledge. We grouped these into 6 categories:  learning about journey mapping, defining goals, gathering and conducting research, collaborating on the map, visualizing and communicating the journey, and bonus words of encouragement.</p><h2> Getting Started with Journey Mapping</h2><h2> Defining Goals, Team, and Scope</h2><h2> Gathering and Conducting Research</h2><h2> Collaborating on the Map</h2><h2> Visualizing and Communicating the Journey</h2><h2> Final Thoughts and Words of Encouragement</h2><h2> Conclusion</h2><p> Journey mapping is not new, and many teams have struggled, stumbled, succeeded, and sometimes even failed at it.
