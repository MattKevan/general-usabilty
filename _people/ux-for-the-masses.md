A former techy turned UX Jedi, for over 15 years I’ve been harnessing the power of user-centred design to deliver compelling and successful user experiences. I have a Human-Computer Interaction MSc (Distinction) from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) along with a Computer Science BSc (First Class) from the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/).

I’m currently a product designer at [Redgate software](https://www.red-gate.com/). Previously I have led the UX for projects at [CashFlows](https://www.cashflows.com/) (a fintech start-up), [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/) (a biopharmaceutical company), [ProQuest](http://www.proquest.com/) (a content & technology company), [Omobono](http://www.omobono.com/) (a specialist B2B digital agency), [TUI](http://www.tuitravelplc.com/) (Europe’s largest holiday tour operator), [johnlewis.com](http://www.johnlewis.com/)(a leading UK ecommerce website), [Cambridge Assessment](http://www.cambridgeassessment.org.uk/) (an international exams group) and been a UX consultant for [Webcredible](http://www.webcredible.co.uk/) (an industry leading UX consultancy) and a full service digital agency.

I currently live in Cambridge in the UK with my wife and two children.
