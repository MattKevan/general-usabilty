					<h3>Welcome to UX Lift</h3>

					<p>I started this site as a way to organise the collection of useful links I'd been building for years, more for my own benefit than anything. However as it came together, I realised it might be a handy resource for others. I hope you find it useful.</p>

					<p>I'm always interested in new content, so if you've made something great or have any links to share, <a href="https://uxlift.typeform.com/to/F4PDel" target="_blank">I'd love to hear from you</a>.</p>

					<h3> Made in Manchester by Matt Kevan</h3>

					<p>I'm a lead UX designer, currently at <a href="https://www.ao.com" target="_blank">ao.com</a>. I've been designing and building digital products for many years, including leading the UX and product teams at <a href="https://www.mumsnet.com" target="_blank">Mumsnet</a>, and working for a wide range of national and international clients.</p> 	

					<h3>Technical notes</h3>

					<p>This site is built with <a href="https://www.jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://www.getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, stored in <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">Github</a> and hosted by <a href="https://www.netlify.com" target="_blank">Netlify</a>. The font is <a href="https://github.com/IBM/plex" target="_blank">Plex Sans</a>.</p>
