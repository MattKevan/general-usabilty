<h3> Made by Matt Kevan</h3>
<p>I'm a UX lead based in Manchester, currently working at AO.com. There's so much good content out there, so I started this site as a personal tool to keep track of interesting articles, tools and resources. As the site grew, I realised that it might be useful for others too.</p>
