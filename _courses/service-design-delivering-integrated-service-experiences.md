In a service design process, you use an in-depth understanding of the business and its customers to ensure that **all the touchpoints of your service are perfect** and, just as importantly, that your organization can **deliver a great service experience every time**. It’s not just about designing the customer interactions; you also need to design the entire ecosystem surrounding those interactions.

In this course, you’ll learn how to go through **a robust service design process** and which methods to use at each step along the way. You’ll also learn how to **create a service design culture** in your organization and **set up a service design team**. We’ll provide you with **lots of case studies** to learn from as well as **interviews with top designers** in the field. For each practical method, you’ll get **downloadable templates that guide you** on how to use the methods in your own work.

This course contains a series of **practical exercises that build on one another to create a complete service design project**. The exercises are optional, but you’ll get invaluable hands-on experience with the methods you encounter in this course if you complete them, because they will teach you to take your first steps as a service designer. What’s equally important is that you can use your work as a case study for your **portfolio to showcase your abilities** to future employers! A portfolio is essential if you want to step into or move ahead in a career in service design.
