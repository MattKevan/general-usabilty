### What you’ll learn

* Why adoption and appropriation matter to a product’s success
* How to place adoption and appropriation in context with UX and usability work
* How to engage users to adopt your products by designing for adoption
* How to design for appropriation of a product by users in order to increase its use, and how “expecting the unexpected” isn’t quite as challenging as it might sound.

Designing for user experience and usability is not enough. If products are not used—and it doesn’t matter _how_ good they are—they will be consigned to the trash can of history.

Sony’s Betamax, Coca-Cola’s New Coke, Pepsi’s Crystal Pepsi, and McDonald’s Arch Deluxe are among the most famous products which made it into production but failed to wow their audiences, according to Business Insider. In fact, _Harvard Business Review_ dedicated a long piece to “Why most product launches fail”—so it’s not just big brands that aren’t getting their design process right but a lot of businesses and individuals, too.

So, what _is_ the way forward? Well, once you’re sure that the user experience and usability of your product work the way you want them to, you’ve got to get your designs **adopted** by users (i.e., they have to start using them). Ideally, you want them to **appropriate** your designs, too; you want the users to start using your designs in ways you didn’t intend or foresee. How do we get our designs adopted and appropriated? We **_design_** for adoption and appropriation.

This course is presented by Alan Dix, a former professor at Lancaster University in the UK and a world-renowned authority in Human-Computer Interaction. Alan is also the author the university-level textbook “Human-Computer Interaction.” It is a short course designed to help you master the concepts and practice of designing for adoption and appropriation. It contains all the basics to get you started on this path and the practical tips to implement the ideas. Alan blends theory and practice to ensure you get to grips with these essential design processes.
