**Learn both UI and UX to build a versatile skill set, no design background required**

All you need is an eye for good visual design and the ability to empathize with your user.

In the course, you'll work on substantial design projects and complete a real world externship with an industry client. After 9 months, you'll graduate with a UI/UX design mindset and a portfolio to show for it.

**Build a unique project portfolio that showcases your UI and UX skills**

In addition to mini-projects throughout the program, you'll complete 4 portfolio projects, including a design sprint - where you will rapidly cycle through the entire design process in one week.

**While working on the projects, you will:**

* Identify a customer problem to solve
* Conduct competitive research
* Sketch, design and build a prototype
* Perform usability testing and identify improvements
* Sharpen your UI/UX skills on a real client project

  You'll be matched with a real company to complete a 40-hour industry design project that solves a business problem.

While working on the industry design project, you'll:
* Collaborate directly with a client for four weeks
* Dive deeper into an area of the UI/UX design process youâ€™re especially interested in: competitive research, user research, usability testing, redesign recommendations
* Set yourself apart from other bootcamp graduates with a personalized portfolio.
