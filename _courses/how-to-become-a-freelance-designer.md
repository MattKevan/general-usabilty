### What you’ll learn

* Whether freelancing or entrepreneurship is for you
* How to set up a successful freelance business
* How to market and sell your business services effectively
* How to handle all the day-to-day management of a freelancer’s and entrepreneur’s practice.

Freelancers and entrepreneurs often get to choose where they work. By redefining the way you work, you can also redesign the way you live. **Once you have the contracts, you can set up wherever you have your heart set on—be it Prague, Delhi, Koh Phangan, Cape Town, or Rio, to name just a few.**It doesn’t matter if you don’t have a ton of savings in the bank—tens of thousands of other freelancers built their freelance businesses from nothing. The founders of the Interaction Design Foundation can attest to this—Mads Soegaard and Rikke Friis Dam built the platform while living in low-cost countries, traveling the world as digital nomads as soon as the internet would allow them to. This enabled them to focus on creating high-quality educational content while having low expenses. It’s an ingenious way of having the best of both worlds (freedom of work _and_ seeing the world), all while keeping the wolves away from the door money-wise. In fact, most of our employees and loyal freelancers now live and work as dedicated and hardworking digital nomads all over the world.

**This course will show you how to create a freelance business from scratch—from overcoming your fears, to the practicalities of making a brand name of yourself.** We will share knowledge regarding how you can start your own design agency or start working as a freelancer from pretty much anywhere, at any time. You will be able to live the life of your dreams while providing high-quality services and products for the benefit of your clients. We will introduce you to the best and most relevant research, as well as ideas and best practices, derived from others who were once in your shoes but who are now living and working the way they always wanted to.

This course is created and presented by one of the founders of the Interaction Design Foundation, Rikke Friis Dam. Rikke is Editor-in-Chief and in charge of our educational profile. She hires and works closely with highly skilled freelancers and entrepreneurs on a daily basis. So, what are you waiting for? There’s no reason for you to sit in an office, counting down the clock and taking orders unless you truly want to live like that. Your clients can be based anywhere on Earth, and so can you; it’s time to quit dreaming and start _doing_.
