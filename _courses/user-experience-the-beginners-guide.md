### What you’ll learn

* An introduction to the areas of study categorized under the umbrella of “user experience”
* Key design principles established over the last four decades that together form the basis of a user’s experience of a product or service
* Key psychological principles that underlie these design principles
* What cognitive processes underlie human-computer interaction, and how to design with this knowledge in mind
* How visual perception affects the viewing experience
* Examples of good and bad design to help you avoid common mistakes
* The importance of usability over aesthetics.

Throughout this course, you will gain a thorough understanding of the various design principles that come together to create a user’s experience when using a product or service. As you proceed, you’ll learn the value user experience design brings to a project, and what areas you must consider when you want to design great user experiences. Because user experience is an evolving term, we can’t give you a definition of ‘user experience’ to end all discussions, but we will provide you with a solid understanding of the different aspects of user experience, so it becomes clear in your mind what is involved in creating great UX designs.
