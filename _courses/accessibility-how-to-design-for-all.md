### What you’ll learn

If you’ve ever tried to optimize your site or app for accessibility, you’ll know it can be a complex and intimidating task… and it can therefore be very tempting to leave it until last or, worse still, avoid it altogether. By understanding that accessibility is about more than just optimizing your code, you’ll find you can build it into your design process. This will **ensure you are taking a disability advocacy approach, and keeping the focus on your users throughout the development process**.

This course will help you achieve exactly that—**from handling images to getting the most out of ARIA markup, you**’ll learn how to approach accessibility from all angles. **You’ll gain practical, hands-on skills that’ll enable you to assess and optimize for common accessibility issues**, as well as show you how to place an emphasis on the quality of the user experience by avoiding classic mistakes. What**’**s more, you’ll also come away with the knowledge to conduct effective accessibility testing through working with users with disabilities.

The course includes interviews with an accessibility specialist and blind user, as well as multiple real-world examples of websites and apps where you can demonstrate your skills through analysis and accessibility tests. Not only will this give you a more practical view of accessibility, but you’ll also be able to optimize your websites and mobile apps in an expert manner—avoiding key mistakes that are commonly made when designing for accessibility.
