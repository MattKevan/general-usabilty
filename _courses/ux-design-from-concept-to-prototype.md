In this UX course, you will explore the process of taking a basic concept, grounded in user needs, and developing it into a design that will address those needs. 

You will gain hands-on experience with techniques such as sketching, scenario development, storyboarding, and wireframing that will help you transform your understanding of what your users need into a compelling user experience. 

You will then learn how to turn wireframes and interaction architecture into interactive prototypes that can be tested with prospective users and iteratively refined into a high quality design that that is ready for a hand-off to the development team for implementation.

What you’ll learn:

* Define and scope the design problem you will try to address
* Create user stories and storyboards to transform information about user needs into design concepts
* Produce sketches and conduct brainstorming sessions to generate many design ideas from which you can construct a high-quality design solution
* Develop interface wireframes to concretize the design and enable early user testing
* Conduct user tests with paper prototypes to get preliminary user feedback on the design concept and interactions
* Develop high-fidelity mockups that specify visual design elements
* Create Wizard of Oz prototypes to efficiently test complex interactions and interactive systems that are not screen-based (e.g., smart assistants)
