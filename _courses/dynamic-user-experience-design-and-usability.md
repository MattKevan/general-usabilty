### What you’ll learn

* How to identify and improve static web designs through the use of dynamic web content
* How to make web pages more interactive without sacrificing usability or accessibility
* How to design for progressive enhancement and graceful degradation
* How to employ dynamic designs on touch-screen devices
* How to give on-screen feedback effectively.

Web technologies make it easy for websites to become more interactive and behave more like native applications. For instance, content on a website can now be loaded dynamically without the browser having to load or refresh the page. However, mindlessly increasing the interactivity of websites can sometimes damage the user experience rather than improve it. How can a designer make use of dynamic content to improve user experience, while making sure that the website is both usable and accessible?

This course will equip you with an understanding of how the use of Ajax (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) can turn a static webpage into a dynamic one. In particular, we will cover how to use Ajax appropriately, so that you can identify areas of a static webpage that the application of dynamic content can improve. At the same time, this course will teach you how to do so without sacrificing usability and accessibility, and hence achieve the optimal user experience. No technical knowledge of Ajax or coding is required, as this course is more focused on the design, rather than implementation, of dynamic web content. Implementation details are hence mentioned only briefly.
