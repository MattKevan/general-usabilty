What you’ll learn

* An introduction to all aspects of Human-Computer Interaction
* How to carry out the design process involved in interaction design, navigation design, and screen design
* How cognition and perception, which encompass attention, memory, thought, the “senses” play a role in affecting the experience of interactive design
* How emotion affects user experience
* How to implement windowing systems, applications, architectures, and frameworks
* How to evaluate user experience using numbers and statistics

Human-computer interaction (HCI) is about understanding what it means to be a user of a computer (which is more complicated than it sounds), and therefore how to create related products and services that work seamlessly. It’s an important skill to master, because it gives any company the perspective and knowledge needed to build products that work more efficiently and therefore sell better. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts the Computer and IT occupation to grow by 12% from 2014–2024, faster than the average for all occupations. This goes to show the immense demand in the market for professionals equipped with the right computer and IT skills.

This course provides a comprehensive introduction and deep dive into HCI, so you can create designs that provide outstanding user experiences. Whether you are a newcomer to the subject of HCI or a professional, by the end of the course you will have a deep understanding of what it means to be a user and how to implement user-centered design for the best possible results.
