### What you’ll learn

* Human attention—in particular, how the brain decides what is most important and therefore what we should look at first
* How to create effective designs, through basing them on how the brain manages and prioritizes the sensory information it receives
* The link between intuition and the evolution of our brains, as well as how to apply this knowledge so as to build software that engages with human intuition
* How to compose screens that work visually, by tapping into the brain science behind visual recognition
* Human recollection, and its implications on designing documents and software that support memory
* How to create products that cater to the brain’s feedback loop, as well as screen controls that tap into our sense of purpose
* How to build technology that makes learning easier, thus becoming more successful
* An understanding of how human and social factors affect technology—including future social and technical evolutions.

When people use technology, a biological information processor (i.e., the brain) interacts with a mechanical information processor (i.e., the computer)—and this _interaction_ will fail if there is no common ground. If you, as a designer, miss the mark between these two worlds of natural and artificial intelligence, they will collide jarringly. This course will therefore **merge brain science and computer science** in order to teach you the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). You will **learn optimal approaches todesigning** better software, mobile applications, and websites, including online communities, by learning how to create software that interacts with human _intuitions_. Such knowledge of HCI is now a critical skill—building new hardware and software goods will result in _negative returns on investment_ (ROI) if users can’t or don’t want to use them. **Designers must know the basics of brain science** in order to practice computer science, not only for people but for communities, too.

The course is created and presented by Brian Whitworth, a registered psychologist who is also trained in computing and has a wealth of experience and qualifications in both fields: BA (Psych), BSc (Maths), MA (Psych), PhD (IS), and Major (Retd.). Each lesson highlights a particular brain-technology difference and uses it to explain what works—and what doesn’t—when people use technology. Every lesson is further divided into ten-minute video blocks, that you can watch independently, so as to fit your learning experience into a busy schedule.
