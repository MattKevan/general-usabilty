### What you’ll learn

* A deep, cognitive understanding of the human behind the term “user,” including the user’s memory and decision-making and problem-solving skills
* How to understand what the user sees when confronted by your product
* How to identify potential pitfalls in your design before any of them become a problem for your users
* How to elevate your design above those of your competitors by creating user-centered products, virtually free from frustrating elements
* How to design products that provide satisfying user experience and, in turn, increase sales.

A deep understanding of human psychology is essential for all designers when creating a user-centered product with great user experience. While many individual differences will never cease to exist between users, we are united by our shared psychology; the constraints and abilities of the human mind are much the same for all of us. Developing an understanding of these cognitive limitations and capabilities is the key to interaction design and a great user experience. Without an awareness of how we interact with things in the real and virtual worlds, you’ll find that your designs will fall short of their potential.

This course will equip you with the knowledge to relate to your users psychologically, thus allowing you to create stand-out products. Through learning about different aspects of human cognition—and how they relate to interaction design—you will find yourself much better equipped to put yourself in your users’ shoes, shifting their thoughts to the forefront and keeping a firm hold of them there when designing your next creation.
