### What you’ll learn

* The principles of user-centered design and to apply them to your designs to improve usability
* How to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of alternative designs
* Why it is important to have clear, conceptual models and early design
* The importance of involving users in the design process
* Basic usability and accessibility guidelines that you can apply to your designs

Usability and profitability are two sides of the same coin. **Simple improvements in usability can greatly increase the probability that your e-commerce site will be a success**... however, the opposite is also true! It is therefore crucial that all designers consider usability early on in the design process, especially seeing as such knowledge is also applicable to wider contexts—such as improving productivity and job satisfaction in the workplace.
