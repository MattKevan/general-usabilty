### What you’ll learn

* How user interface (UI) design patterns can speed up your design processes
* How to choose user interface design patterns and use them appropriately
* How to organize content to achieve maximum usability
* How to ensure minimal effort is required from the user when moving through the user interface
* How to simplify data entry and reduce errors
* How to use social aspects within your user interface designs
* How to enhance the user experience of a user interface

User interface design patterns are the means by which structure and order can gel together to make powerful user experiences. Structure and order are also a user’s best friends, and along with the fact that old habits die hard (especially on the web), it is essential that designers consider user interfaces very carefully before they set the final design in stone. 

Products should consist of such good interactions that users don’t even notice how they got from point A to point B. Failing to do so can lead to user interfaces that are difficult or confusing to navigate, requiring the user to spend an unreasonable amount of time decoding the display—and just a few seconds too many can be “unreasonable”—rather than fulfilling their original aims and objectives.
