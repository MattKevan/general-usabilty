### What you’ll learn

* An understanding of the basics of usability, including visual design, navigation and menu design, search engine optimization, and accessibility
* How to design for efficiency and persuasion
* What lean and agile processes are
* How to integrate user-centered design into lean and agile development
* How to make a case for user-centered design
* How to engage the whole team in user-centered design.

By completing the course, you will become equipped with the tools required to create products with outstanding user experience and usability. Your newly acquired knowledge will also enable you to reduce the costs, risk, and time required to design and implement such products.

You’ll learn to adopt a user-centered approach to UX design and usability so you can create user-friendly products that people love to use—for example, by allowing for user errors and providing timely feedback messages. More importantly, it is crucial that your entire team—developers, project managers, and product owners alike—adopt this holistic, user-centered mindset. This course therefore aims to provide any team member with just that: it will not only equip you with fundamental usability and design concepts, but also introduce you to lean and agile processes that will allow your whole team to become design-centric.
