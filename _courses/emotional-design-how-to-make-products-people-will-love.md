### What you’ll learn

* The relationship between emotion and design, and how to tap into it for more effective designs
* How human factors affect the emotional responses to a design, with real-life examples
* How to design for positive emotional experiences
* What the “Triune Brain” is, and how to apply it to your work
* The difference between visceral, behavioral and reflective design, and how to encourage positive visceral, behavioral and reflective processing.

An understanding of emotional design—how users feel and what affects these feelings—is essential if you want to provide great user experiences. There are probably things near you right now that are not necessarily the best, and they might not even be particularly attractive, but you are nonetheless still using them. Take a seashell from your favorite beach, or your very first tennis racket, for example; they are meaningful to you, and you consequently feel a connection to them. These connections are powerful; they subconsciously affect you and have the capacity to turn inanimate objects into evocative extensions of you as an individual.

In this course, we will provide you with the information necessary to elicit such positive emotional experiences through your designs. Human-computer interaction (HCI) specialist Alan Dix provides video content for each of the lessons, helping to crystallize the information covered throughout the course. By the end of it, you will have a better understanding of the relationship between people and the things they use in their everyday lives and, more importantly, how to design new products and websites which elicit certain emotional responses.
