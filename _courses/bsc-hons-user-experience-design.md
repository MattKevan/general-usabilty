You are curious about how design can influence human behaviour – guiding people’s actions and decisions.

You are eager to learn how to test your ideas and work through versions towards the most effective creative solution to whatever problem you’re trying to solve – whether you’re designing an app, website, or physical product.

You’ll learn research and analytical skills that will help you to understand how people react in the face of different design experiences online and in the physical world.

You’ll be able to take those research findings – combined with an understanding of human psychology and commercial trends – to create and test prototypes for a service, product or business.

### Rooted in design skills

Your shared first-year with our Graphics students will ensure you understand the principles of effective design, the art of asking questions to understand a brief, and begin to develop the design skills address different creative challenges.

### Industry-ready UX skills

In years two and three, you will discover how user experience designers working in different industries gather data through ethnographic research and combine these insights with other data sources such as website statistics and industry trends.

You’ll learn how to analyse and apply that data to devise and refine a digital experience that works best in any given situation.

### Links to business

You’ll learn how to work with the commercial sector through contact with businesses via live briefs and a student-led consultancy, developing project management, communication and collaborative working skills that will make your CV stand out to employers.
