In this course, we'll learn the ins and outs of ProtoPie, from basic techniques to advanced prototyping. We'll start the course with a solid workflow and quick prototyping techniques in order to create a working prototype that can be previewed on your device. Then, we'll dive deep into animation techniques and complex interactions that will really elevate your design. 

This course isn't just about the tool, it's also about learning how to design an app, bringing it to life and getting tons of tips and tricks in between. 

As with most prototyping tools, you need to be somewhat familiar with design tools to be able to understand the core concepts of prototyping.
