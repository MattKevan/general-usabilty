title: About UX Lift
description: I launched UX Lift as a side project in 2017 as a way to organise the huge collection of UX and design links I'd built over the years.

As the site came together, I realised it could be useful to both to new and experienced designers. While there are loads of good resources out there, I hadn't found anywhere that attempted to collect everything together in one place.

I've had nearly twenty years experience working across UX design, graphic design, product management and web development, so I've carefully chosen all the content on this site to both improve the craft of UX design and help place it in its wider context.

My goal is to make UX Lift the best possible resource for everything UX and design-related on the web, and I hope you'll find it useful.
