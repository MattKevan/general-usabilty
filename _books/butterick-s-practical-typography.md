I’m not here to tell you that typography is more important than the substance of your writing. It’s not.

But typography can enhance your writing. Typography can create a better first impression. Typography can reinforce your key points. Typography can extend reader attention. When you ignore typography, you’re ignoring an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of your writing.

And isn’t that why you write at all? To have an effect on readers? To move them, to persuade them, to spur them to action?

If so, then you should want what typography has to offer. Best of all, it’s fast and it’s easy. Unlike, say, learning to be a better writer.
