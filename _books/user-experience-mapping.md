If you want to create better products and innovative solutions, user experience maps will help you understand users, gain strategic insights, and improve communication with stakeholders. Maps will also help you champion user-centricity within your organization.

This book is one of the first resources to cover two advanced mapping techniquesâ€”the behavioral change map and the 4D UX map. As you explore user story maps, task models, journey maps, and many more, you'll learn how to use insights from real users to create and improve your maps and products.
