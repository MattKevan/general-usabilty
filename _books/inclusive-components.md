The aim is to find more accessible and robust solutions for the patterns we author, plug in, and use every day.

Each chapter tackles a single component, addressing how different and vulnerable people might read and interact with it, and how they can be better accommodated. The in-depth explorations are meticulously illustrated and code examples culminate as working demos.

Inclusive design is not about wrong and right, but _bad to better_. You'll learn plenty of tips from **Inclusive Components**, but you'll also adopt the mindset to go on and make even better components.
