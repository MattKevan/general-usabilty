title: "UX Writing is the Key to Effective Onboarding"
date: 2021-01-26
description: "Effective UX writing explains how the product or service works and guides the user through the process of using it. One area in which it can be particularly helpful is onboarding. Data from Localytics shows that only a little over a third of users continue to use an app three months after initially downloading it, and one of the major culprits when it comes to abandonment, is ineffective user onboarding. In this article, we will talk you through how using the right copy can make a huge difference to a userâ€™s experience of a new product."
