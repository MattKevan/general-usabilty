title: 'HTML: The Inaccessible Parts'
description: I’ve always abided in the idea that “HTML is accessible by default and
  then we come along and mess it up.” In a lot places this is very true and by just
  using a suitable HTML element instead of a generic div or span we can have a big
  Accessibility impact.
