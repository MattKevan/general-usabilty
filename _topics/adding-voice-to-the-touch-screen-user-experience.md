title: "Adding Voice to the Touch Screen User Experience"
date: 2021-01-19
description: "While touch screens have greatly enhanced the user experience of our mobile devices, there are some usability issues that arise from a combination of a small screen and lack of a physical keyboard. As apps get more complex we need to look beyond just improving the tap and gesture-based user interface to look at other modalities like voice. If done right, expanding the user's interaction to include voice has the potential to make for a more fluid, efficient, and overall more enjoyable experience."
