title: Four ways design systems can promote accessibility – and what they can’t do
description: Design systems help us to make our products consistent, and to make sure
  we’re creating them in the most efficient way possible. They also help us to ensure
  our products are designed and built to a high quality; that they’re not only consistent
  in appearance, and efficiently-built, but that they are good. And good design means
  accessible design.
