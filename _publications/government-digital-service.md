Weâ€™re a centre of excellence in digital, technology and data, collaborating with departments to help them with their own transformation. We work with them to build platforms, standards, and digital services.

We always start with [user needs](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs.html). We are [agile](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/06/30/outcomes-not-deliverables/). We work to a set of [Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles) that guide us in everything we do.

We believe in working openly, because [making things open makes them better](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#tenth).

We run [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/), the best place to find government services and information. It began as an alpha, [built in just 10 weeks](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2011/07/29/alpha-gov-uk-wrap-up/), and has grown to become [part of our national digital infrastructure](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/11/20/2-billion-and-counting/). It's always being improved in response to user research and user feedback.
