Conducting an analytics review is a good way of determining what does and doesn't work on a page or website before beginning any work. This could include popular site sections or content, landing page conversion rates, navigation quality etc.

It's also useful to get an idea of how a site is currently performing, so that the impact of any changes – both positive or negative – can be measured.
