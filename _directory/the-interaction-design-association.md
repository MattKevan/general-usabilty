IxDA was incorporated in 2005 to address the needs of the then-emergent field of interaction design. In the intervening years, interaction design has grown as a industry and an area of study, at the same time the recognition of its value in the creation of great products has grown.

We were the first community for those interested in the practice of interaction design, and now we are the largest, with over 200 local groups and more than 100,000 individuals globally. We are driven by a passion for design, and a belief that our practice of interaction design can make the world a better place. Through local meetups to global events and initiatives, this community comes together to connect, to advance our professional craft and improve our shared human condition through that effort.
