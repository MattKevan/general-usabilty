#### UX writing

It’s not enough to design with dummy text and fill in the real copy later – the text needs to be considered early in the process as often text problems reveal design problems. If you’re having a problem with the text, there’s a good chance there’s a problem with the design too.

Here’s some good resources on how to write better for user experience:
