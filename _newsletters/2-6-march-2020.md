### Forms and accessibility

Following on from the article by GDS, I’ve been researching best practice around form fields – it turns out that they’re not very accessible, and lot of things we do to make them look better often make them worse.

* [HTML: The Inaccessible Parts](https://daverupert.com/2020/02/html-the-inaccessible-parts/) – a roundup of findings related to the accessibility of different form fields.
* [Stop using Material Design text fields](https://www.matsuko.ca/blog/stop-using-material-design-text-fields/) – why Material-style floating placeholders are inconsistent and fragile.
* [Placeholders in Form Fields Are Harmful ](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/)– how placeholders hurt accessibility more than they help.
* [Form design patterns (Book)](https://formdesignpatterns.com/) – a practical guide to designing and coding simple and inclusive forms for the web (I have a copy if anyone wants to borrow).

### Critiquing design

Getting and giving good feedback on designs is an essential part of the design process. But like most things, it’s a skill and takes practice to develop.

### Obligatory design system article

Is it possible to build a design system that enables designers to be creative, or are they just a set of rules to follow?
