**Atomic design system**

An ongoing series of case studies documenting building a design system – what worked, what didn’t work etc. Interesting to see how we could document the process of ours.

**Accessibility and input fields**

GDS demonstrating how they’re thinking in great detail about accessibility and using the best methods for data entry. Lessons for us when designing forms, especially when it comes to the basket and checkout.

**Foldable design**

With the launch of the new Razr and the Galaxy Flip, are foldable phones going to go mainstream. Do we need to start making sure our designs can be folded? From the reviews, [probably not just yet](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/02/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-foldables-arent-forever-doomed-to-failure/), but the trend is only going to increase.

**Regarding your creativity**

Another great video from Ze Frank.
