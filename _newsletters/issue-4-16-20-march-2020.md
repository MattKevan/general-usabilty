#### Cool tools

[**Affinity**](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/store/) currently have a 3 month free trial and half-price sale on their Photoshop / InDesign / Illustrator alternatives. Seriously good software and a steal at less than £24 each. Switched from Adobe to Affinity for all my personal projects a while ago and haven’t looked back.

[**Handmirror**](https://handmirror.app/) – one-click camera check from the menu bar, vital pre-videoconference

[**JQBX**](https://jqbx.fm/) – listen to music together but also remotely. A home-working alternative to the office stereo.
